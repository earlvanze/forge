<br>

A harness-agnostic code-change workflow. Your request gets planned, the plan gets attacked, the code gets written with tests, and a panel of reviewers shoots at it before you ever see it.

One markdown core, thin per-harness adapters. Runs on **Claude Code**, **codex**, and **opencode** — each declaring how far it can enforce the workflow, stated honestly.

**Site:** [alp82.github.io/forge](https://alp82.github.io/forge/) — live demos: the full run, every stage, the crossfire wave

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add alp82/forge
/plugin install forge@alperortac
/forge:setup-forge
```

The setup runs once, plugin-prefixed; it installs the bare command names, so from then on it's `/setup-forge` everywhere. Plugin updates propagate on their own — no re-run needed.

Upgrading from alp-river? Three steps in the [2.0.0 changelog entry](CHANGELOG.md).

### Install (opencode)

Inside an [opencode](https://opencode.ai) session, paste:

```
Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alp82/forge/main/adapters/opencode/INSTALL.md and follow it.
```

The session installs forge globally and verifies every capability live. On opencode, forge runs guarded: git-write guard and idle review nudge, no stop-gate — opencode cannot block a session from ending. Details in the [opencode adapter README](adapters/opencode/README.md).

### Install (codex)

In a terminal with [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex) installed:

```
codex plugin marketplace add alp82/forge
```

then install the `forge` plugin and run the `$setup-forge` skill inside a codex session. Setup enables hooks (with consent), generates the tier agents, and verifies every capability live. On codex, forge runs gated — the same stop-gate as Claude Code blocks a session ending on failing tests or unreviewed code. Details in the [codex adapter README](adapters/codex/README.md).

> [!TIP]
> Run the main session on a top-tier model at high effort. The orchestrator drives every routing decision, so a weaker main model degrades the whole pipeline.

## Use

One verb. Describe the change you want in your own words.

```
/forge add rate limiting to the public API
/forge #482                    # or point it at a ticket
/crossfire                     # review what's already there
```

Per-stage micro-casts and the standalone crossfire wave play on [the site](https://alp82.github.io/forge/).

## What happens

| Stage | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| triage | Sizes the request and detects what's missing: unknowns get interviewed, unproven externals get prototyped, missing knowledge gets researched, a bug gets diagnosed before anything is built. |
| plan | Writes the approach to a file, not the chat — the next stage reads a document, and a fresh agent can pick it up after compaction. |
| challenge | A second agent tries to break the plan before a line is written. Cheapest possible place to be wrong. |
| tests | Writes the red tests first, aimed at the behavior the request asked for — then a second agent hunts for false green: the test that passes with the feature deleted, the mock asserting on itself. Code waits until the tests prove something. |
| implement | Makes the change against the surviving plan and turns the tests green. |
| crossfire | Independent reviewers hit the diff at once, each carrying one lens, blind to the others. Also runs standalone as `/crossfire` on any diff, branch, or file set. |
| fix | Works the findings until the diff survives a clean re-run of the wave. |

With a worker CLI on PATH (codex, gemini, opencode), the challenge and the crossfire wave each get a different-model second opinion when the change's risk calls for one - read-only, failure visible, never blocking.

## It can't skip the review

Prompts get forgotten under compaction; hooks don't. On a **gated** harness (Claude Code, codex) forge ships the full enforcement layer — six hooks on Claude Code — and if code changed and the review never ran, the session refuses to end. Where the harness can't block a session from ending (opencode, **guarded**), the same hooks still guard writes and nudge the unreviewed diff. The guarantee degrades by tier — loudly, never in silence — and each adapter's declared tier is stated in its install section and README.

## It's just markdown

No agent definitions, no config language, no signal vocabulary. Every stage is a markdown file you can read in one sitting and edit with your own opinions — start at [`skills/forge/SKILL.md`](skills/forge/SKILL.md). The plugin is a delivery mechanism, nothing more.

## Works with your tracker

Point `/forge` at a ticket and it reads the ticket as the request, then posts the verdict back and closes it. No tracker? Nothing is missing — the contract lies dormant.
