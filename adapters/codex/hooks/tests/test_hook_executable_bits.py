"""Guard: every hook script invoked DIRECTLY by hooks.json must be executable.

CONTRACT:
  - A hook whose command runs the script itself (first token is the template
    basename <name>.sh - install-forge-hooks.py resolves it to an absolute path)
    is exec'd by the OS, so the file needs the executable bit. The bit that matters is
    the one git TRACKS (mode 100755), because that is what propagates into an
    installed plugin - a working-tree chmod that never reaches the index still
    ships a non-executable file and fails at SessionStart with "Permission
    denied".
  - A command that passes a script TO an interpreter (python3 .../x.py) does
    not need the bit; the interpreter is the executable. Those are correctly
    skipped here.

This is the cheap canary for the class of bug where a directly-exec'd hook
ships as 100644 and silently never runs at its event - flipping the tracked
mode to 100755 makes it GREEN.
