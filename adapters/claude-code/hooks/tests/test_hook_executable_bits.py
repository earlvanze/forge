"""Guard: every hook script invoked DIRECTLY by hooks.json must be executable.

CONTRACT:
  - A hook whose command runs the script itself (first token is
    ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/adapters/claude-code/hooks/<name>.sh) is exec'd by
    the OS, so the file
    needs the executable bit. The bit that matters is the one git TRACKS
    (mode 100755), because that is what propagates into the plugin cache on
    install - a working-tree chmod that never reaches the index still ships a
    non-executable file and fails at SessionStart with "Permission denied".
  - A command that passes a script TO an interpreter (python3 .../x.py,
    bash .../x.sh) does not need the bit; the interpreter is the executable.
    Those are correctly skipped here.

This is the cheap canary for the class of bug where a directly-exec'd hook
ships as 100644 and silently never runs at its event - flipping the tracked
mode to 100755 makes it GREEN.
