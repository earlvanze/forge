"""Shared helpers for the Stop-gate system (verify-tests.py, verify-build.py,
review-owed.py).

The verifiers run at Stop (end of turn) and gate on a per-session "code
changed" marker armed by mark-code-change.py: absent the marker they exit
before any command detection or subprocess. run_verify_gate() is the shared
skeleton both verify scripts call; the only per-script differences are the
command detector and the marker/message/timeout parameters. review-owed.py is
a sibling gate on its own marker - it runs no command, so it only borrows the
marker helpers.

CHANGE_MARKER_PREFIXES is the single home for the three marker names - the
PostToolUse writer (mark-code-change.py) and every reader import them from
here so they cannot drift.

Stdlib only. session_marker() carries the session-keyed /tmp convention with a
pid-keyed fallback.
