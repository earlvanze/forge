"""Verify gate: build / typecheck the project before allowing a stop.

Activates whenever a build/typecheck tool resolves locally for the project and a
per-session change marker (armed by mark-code-change.py) is present - a chat-only
turn exits before any command detection or subprocess. Fires at Stop at end of
turn whenever code changed. Max 1 retry per session.

Conservative by construction: the build/typecheck runs ONLY when its tool is
locally present (no npx-on-miss downloads/hangs). A timeout is treated as a
non-blocking pass-through. For rust/go this checks the compile-error class
(cargo check / go build -o /dev/null) - it does not assert artifact parity.

Stdlib only. Always exits 0 (Claude hook contract). A failing build is signalled
by a single JSON block on stdout; every pass/skip branch prints nothing. Building
the JSON via json.dumps makes the exit-code footgun and the jq-injection class
structurally impossible.
