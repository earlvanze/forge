# Changelog

All notable changes to forge (previously alp-river). Versions match `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

## 2.3.0 - 2026-07-26

forge now proportions its process to each change: how big the change is and how much damage it could do if wrong are judged separately, and each judgment opens only the steps it warrants.

- Small, dangerous changes get a concise plan, an independent second look, and the user's sign-off.
- Large, safe changes get full planning and structural review with no sign-off stop.
- Small, safe changes keep the existing fast path.
- Every change is still reviewed for correctness and for delivering what was asked.

## 2.2.4 - 2026-07-25

- A clean review now always settles the unreviewed-code gate, even when a check reports its findings back as text.
- Every review check now records its findings by a route the tooling cannot block, so nothing is left to improvise its own.

## 2.2.3 - 2026-07-24

- The model can now route code-modifying requests into forge on its own instead of waiting for the user to type the command.
- The model can now fire the review wave the end-of-turn gate asks for, instead of being blocked with a demand it could not satisfy.
- The unreviewed-code gate now blocks once per review debt instead of re-blocking after every edit; further changes fold into an open debt silently, and the gate re-arms only after a review settles it.

## 2.2.2 - 2026-07-21

- forge's independent second opinion now always comes from a different AI model than the one running forge, so the check can no longer be one model agreeing with itself.
- The second opinion can now come from Claude, alongside the existing Codex, Gemini, and opencode options.
- A second-opinion tool that hangs is now cut off after three minutes and reported as failed, instead of stalling the run.

## 2.2.1 - 2026-07-20

- On machines with a custom opencode config directory, forge's plugin and agents now install where opencode reads them, so enforcement takes effect instead of silently doing nothing.
- When forge is also installed for Claude Code on the same machine, the opencode install now flags the harmless duplicate-skill warning up front instead of leaving it unexplained.

## 2.2.0 - 2026-07-20

forge now installs on Codex CLI through its native plugin marketplace. Codex is the first platform besides Claude Code where forge runs fully gated: a session cannot end on failing tests, a broken build, or unreviewed code.

- forge runs on Codex CLI with the git-write guard, change tracking, and the full stop-gate. The enforcement hooks install into Codex's own hooks file (`$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json`), which the setup skill writes and trusts — codex's `hooks` feature is stable and on by default, so nothing opt-in is required.
- Installing is one marketplace command plus a setup run that writes and trusts the hooks, then checks every promised capability against the live environment and reports anything the environment refuses.
- With the third adapter shipped, the README and site now present forge as harness-agnostic rather than a Claude Code tool — naming all three harnesses and stating each one's enforcement tier plainly: Claude Code and codex gated, opencode guarded.

## 2.1.1 - 2026-07-20

- On current opencode, forge's git-write guard and start-of-session reminder now take effect; on recent releases the install finished but silently enforced nothing.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-07-18

forge now installs under opencode. One paste inside an opencode session sets everything up globally, checks each promised capability against the live environment, and reports what it got.

- forge runs on opencode with the git-write guard and an end-of-work review reminder; opencode cannot stop a session from ending, and the install says so plainly instead of pretending otherwise.
- Installing is one pasted line; updating is re-pasting the same line, and a startup notice says when the installed copies have gone stale.

## 2.0.5 - 2026-07-18

- Everything Claude-Code-specific now lives under `adapters/claude-code/` - the hooks and the setup skill moved there, leaving root `skills/` holding only the harness-neutral pipeline (forge + crossfire). The plugin manifest points at the new locations, so installs and updates keep working unchanged.
- The Claude Code adapter now ships its capability declaration (`capabilities.json`) and an adapter README stating its enforcement tier, per the adapter contract.

## 2.0.4 - 2026-07-18

- The skill briefs no longer name Claude-specific models or mechanisms, so the same briefs can run under other agent CLIs.
- A forge run now checks at the start whether its enforcement layer is present and says plainly when it is running without it.

## 2.0.3 - 2026-07-17

- The end-of-session review reminder now clears once a review has actually run, instead of repeating after a completed review wave.

## 2.0.2 - 2026-07-17

- The installed command names now survive plugin updates instead of breaking when a new version lands.
- Sessions now warn when an earlier install is still wired the old way and name the one command that fixes it.

## 2.0.1 - 2026-07-17

- Writing the red tests and auditing them for false green now read as one tests stage across the pipeline, docs, and site - the audit still runs as its own independent check inside it.

## 2.0.0 - 2026-07-17

This release is a rename: **forge**, previously alp-river. Same repo, same changelog, new name - GitHub redirects the old URLs, but the plugin entry itself is new, so an installed alp-river no longer updates and must be swapped once.

The shape underneath the name changed over the 1.4.x line: the routed pipeline of dozens of agent definitions became two readable skills. /forge takes a code-modifying request from intent to ship - triage, plan, challenge, test-first build, review, fix - and /crossfire fires a parallel review wave over any diff, branch, or file set. Everything the pipeline knows lives in plain markdown files you can open and edit.

Migrating from alp-river takes three steps:

1. `/plugin uninstall alp-river`
2. `/plugin install forge@alperortac`
3. Run `/setup-forge`

- The plugin is now named forge; installed copies of alp-river stop receiving updates until swapped.
- The public commands are /forge, /crossfire, and /setup-forge - bare names, no plugin prefix, available in any project after setup.
- /setup-forge installs the skills once and configures per-repo conventions; plugin updates then propagate without re-running it.

## 1.4.3 - 2026-07-17

- The old pipeline surface is removed: the /go and /review commands, all agent definitions, and the workflow doctrine files are gone - the forge and crossfire skills carry the whole flow.
- The self-audit and reflect commands leave the plugin and continue as repo-internal skills working against the skill files.
- Contributor docs now describe the skill-first layout; changelog entry rules moved there.

## 1.4.2 - 2026-07-17

- End-of-turn checks gain a third gate: a session that changed code but never ran a review is blocked once and pointed at the review step.
- Session start now injects a three-line pointer (entry rule, flow location, stale-skill nag) instead of the workflow essentials block.
- Automatic post-edit formatting and desktop notifications left the plugin; re-add them in your personal settings to keep them.
- The deterministic step router and its agent catalog are removed; the flow now lives in the forge and crossfire skill files.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-07-11

- Questions on decisions that matter now state each option's pros and cons in plain words, alongside a concrete example of what picking it means.
- Options now point at the evidence behind them: an illustration file to open and the sources found during research.
- When a topic needs background, a short background doc can now be produced instead of only an interactive illustration.
- Routine yes/no confirmations stay as terse as before.

## 1.4.0 - 2026-07-11

The plugin slims down: four side systems are removed so a run carries only the pipeline itself - user memory injection, per-step doctrine, the on-disk plan handle, and the session-start gitignore guard stay.

- The guided project-docs setup is gone: no more setup interview, no INTENT/STACK/GLOSSARY files injected into steps, and no session-start nudge to create them.
- The end-of-run capture step that proposed glossary and stack updates is gone.
- The architecture-decision-record command and its drafting step are gone.
- The crash-recovery state file written every turn is gone; after a compaction the workflow pointer is re-anchored and progress is reconciled from the working tree. One honest edge: a deliberately-red test turn that ends mid-run can now block once at the end-of-turn check before the retry cap lets it through.

## 1.3.16 - 2026-07-09

- When a question is easier to grasp by seeing it - how parts fit together, how information is laid out, or a choice between options - the assistant now builds a small illustration first and asks with it in hand.

## 1.3.15 - 2026-07-09

- Requests bigger than a small tweak now get a short interview before planning; a clear ask passes through with zero questions.
- Test and build checks now run at the end of the turn once a build's code is complete; a run abandoned before that can still keep them off, for at most a day.
- When the strongest planning model is unavailable and the failure is visible, the affected step retries once on the next-best model and notes the swap.

## 1.3.14 - 2026-07-09

- Most steps of a run now use a lighter, cheaper model, while the most capable model stays reserved for planning and building the code, so a run costs less without losing depth where the decisions matter.
- Each step now thinks for a length matched to its job, keeping the deepest planning and review work thorough while trimming wasted effort elsewhere.

## 1.3.13 - 2026-07-09

- Run progress shows as compact state-arrow lines in plain words, like `plan approved ▶ starting implementation`, instead of narrated sentences.
- Side notes during a run shrink to an event plus a short reason in parentheses, like `stop hook ignored (implementation ongoing)`; full sentences appear only where a decision or action is needed.

## 1.3.12 - 2026-07-09

- The core rulebook is about half its former length, so every run carries less instruction overhead and reads one contradiction-free set of rules.
- Decision points now settle directly in chat; the separate interactive comparison page is gone.
- The end-of-run timing summary is gone.

## 1.3.11 - 2026-07-09

- Helper steps are no longer told to open their reply by reciting a persona motto, removing the risk of a corrupted first line in steps whose output must start with an exact marker.
- The separate persona layer is gone: the two conversational steps - discussion and plan challenge - now carry their voice in their own instructions, and no other step gets one.
- The decision-record summary carried in project context is now built in one pass over all record files instead of several helper processes per file.

## 1.3.10 - 2026-07-08

- The git safety guard now checks only commands actually being run, so commit messages and echoed text that merely mention a blocked command pass, read-only `git stash list`/`show` are allowed, and a machine without the jq tool gets a logged warning instead of every command being refused.
- macOS desktop notifications containing quotes or backslashes now display correctly.
- The repo health check no longer counts lookalike words such as "also" as an explanation.
- Saving a non-plugin file no longer loads an unused YAML parser.

## 1.3.9 - 2026-07-08

- Every serious build now ends with five focused always-on review checks instead of twelve overlapping ones: correctness, simplicity, shape (module structure), conventions (naming, patterns, reuse), and acceptance (the right thing got built, per the plan).
- The performance check joins only when the change actually touches data access, loops over collections, queries, or payload assembly - clean of guesswork, it flags only costs readable from the code itself.
- After a fix, only the checks that found the fixed problems re-run, plus the correctness check and the test suite - fix rounds get much cheaper without losing coverage.

## 1.3.8 - 2026-07-04

- An unclear request is now clarified in a single question-and-answer loop that keeps going until the goal is genuinely clear, instead of two separate loops that each stopped at a fixed number of rounds.

## 1.3.7 - 2026-07-04

- A trivial code change - a single-file edit with no new logic, like a typo fix, a doc tweak, a config value, or a version bump - now takes a genuinely short path: it goes straight to making the change plus a correctness check, skipping the planning step it used to run first.
- Larger and logic-carrying changes are unaffected: they still get the full plan-and-review treatment.

## 1.3.6 - 2026-07-04

- Finishing a reply that changed no files now skips the end-of-turn test and build checks entirely, saving up to about five minutes on chat-only turns; the checks still run after every real code edit.
- During an in-flight task run, the end-of-turn checks wait and run once at the finish instead of after every intermediate step.
- The after-save formatter no longer holds up the turn and never downloads formatter packages; projects without the formatter installed are skipped silently.

## 1.3.5 - 2026-07-03

- Saving the run's progress each turn is now a single direct write instead of a delegated background helper call, cutting one background model call from every loop turn with recovery behavior unchanged.

## 1.3.4 - 2026-07-02

- Resuming an interrupted session now reliably picks up from the latest saved step, not an early stale one.
- More history-destroying git commands are now blocked as user-only, including restoring files from another branch or commit.
- Saved memory notes can no longer pull in files outside the notes folder.
- The docs and the built-in health check are back in sync with what ships: current version, complete update history, accurate counts.

## 1.3.3 - 2026-07-02

- The workflow's most demanding steps - planning, judging a plan, extracting what you want, and the deep build, investigation, and authoring work - now run on the strongest model tier again, so those steps get deeper reasoning.
- The scratch folder this tool writes into your project now stays out of version control automatically, with a prompt to stop tracking it if it was already committed.

## 1.3.2 - 2026-06-30

- The resume-after-interruption offer added in 1.3.0 now actually appears on a fresh install. Its startup step had shipped unable to launch, so recovery silently never ran and starting a session surfaced a permission error - both are fixed.
- Shipping a session's work can now go straight to the default branch as the default choice - one commit, pushed, no pull request - with the feature-branch-and-draft-PR flow still available as the second option. You pick the target at the ship prompt, and it shows the exact commands and how to undo each for whichever you choose.

## 1.3.1 - 2026-06-28

- The live progress card now groups each step under its stage of the work - intent, scouting, planning, tests, build, review - in the order the run actually runs them, so what you read always matches what happens next.
- Every progress card now reads in plain words throughout; the internal codes that used to trail a line are gone from what you see.
- The published stage list is now complete, listing two checks that were missing before.

## 1.3.0 - 2026-06-27

This release makes an interrupted session recoverable: when a run is cut off before it finishes, you can pick up where it left off instead of starting over.

- A run cut off mid-task - the process killed, the terminal closed, the machine lost - no longer loses your place; reopening the project offers to resume where it stopped after you confirm.
- Recovering your place after a long conversation is automatically condensed now works reliably.
- Large plans now use much less of the session's working memory throughout a run, with no change to what gets done.

## 1.2.18 - 2026-06-26

- At the points where the assistant asks you to settle direction, confirm intent, or sign off on a plan, you can now pick "See it in plain words" to have the same decision re-stated inline in plain language with a before/after example - and pull up the full interactive page from there if you want more.
- Explanations at those decision points now lead with plain words and a concrete before/after (or input/output) example by default, with jargon trimmed.
- Reviews now finish more reliably: each review reports its own clean-or-issues result explicitly, so the run no longer has to guess from the wording whether a check passed.

## 1.2.17 - 2026-06-25

- When you ask to ship the work from a session, the run now offers to commit it, push the branch, and open a draft pull request for you - only after you confirm, and only when you ask.
- Before it runs, you see exactly which commands will touch the remote and how to undo each one.
- Routine local git work (add, commit, push) now runs without interruption; only destructive git operations (force-push, reset, rebase, branch or remote delete) remain blocked as user-only.

## 1.2.16 - 2026-06-25

- At the moments where the assistant asks you to confirm direction, settle intent, or sign off on a plan, you can now pull up a richer side-by-side view as a single page you open, compare at a glance, and answer from - or stay with the quick inline choice.
- The richer view is built only when you ask for it, and closing it without answering changes nothing - the original question stays open until you decide.

## 1.2.15 - 2026-06-24

- A finished run now ends with a timing summary: total time, time per phase, and time per milestone when the work was built in milestones.

## 1.2.14 - 2026-06-24

- Removed the opt-in screenshot-based visual check because they were unreliable
- The static UI reviews and the design and flow preview pages are unchanged.

## 1.2.13 - 2026-06-18

- A big change with several genuinely different ways to build it can now explore those approaches in parallel and settle on the strongest one, or blend the best parts, before any code is written.

## 1.2.12 - 2026-06-17

- The specialist review and build voices now open by stating their guiding principle in their own words, so each stays in character throughout its work.

## 1.2.11 - 2026-06-17

- The workflow health scorecard now also flags when the same instruction is copied across files and when a hard rule lacks a stated reason.
- Post-build plan checks now follow a structured receipt the build leaves behind, so each planned item traces straight to where it landed.

## 1.2.10 - 2026-06-17

- The workflow health scorecard now tracks a sixth area that flags when load-bearing doctrine wording goes missing.
- Code review now reports bloat as a concrete cut with its replacement named and the lines saved tallied, instead of vague "could be simpler" hedges.
- The doctrine now spells out a floor that must never be simplified away - input validation, data-loss-preventing error handling, security, accessibility, calibration, and the one runnable check behind non-trivial logic.

## 1.2.9 - 2026-06-13

- The handful of stages that were pinned to a now-retired model tier (planning, plan challenge, the intent loops, debugging, and the deepest reviews) now run on the most capable available tier, so no stage points at a model that is no longer offered.

## 1.2.8 - 2026-06-11

- A clear follow-up request now proceeds immediately on a one-line restatement instead of pausing for confirmation; only a genuinely ambiguous one stops to settle intent first.
- Intent and review stages now run at a calmer thinking budget, so clarification loops settle faster and post-build reviews raise fewer speculative flags; the generative planning and plan-challenge stages keep full budget.

## 1.2.7 - 2026-06-11

- The stages whose single output steers the rest of the run - intent, planning, plan challenge, debugging, and the deepest reviews - now run on Claude Code's most capable model tier.

## 1.2.6 - 2026-06-06

- A new command reports a health scorecard for the workflow itself, ranked by the fixes that would help most.
- Reflection can now review saved notes against their conventions and capture new ones, proposing each change for approval before writing.
- Code review now names the specific silent-failure traps it checks for, so swallowed errors and missing timeouts get caught.

## 1.2.5 - 2026-06-05

- The per-turn pipeline status now renders as formatted text, so its step icons and progress markers show reliably instead of as raw monospace.
- The plain-language plan summary shown before approval now reads as formatted prose rather than a monospace block.

## 1.2.4 - 2026-06-05

- Code review now flags unsafe database migrations - non-reversible changes, constraints added without a backfill, and renames that break instances still running during a rollout.
- The build and test completion checks are more reliable, so a failing build or suite can no longer slip through to a clean finish.

## 1.2.3 - 2026-06-05

- Reviews now surface a finding only when it carries a concrete, observable consequence, cutting "this could be cleaner" noise from the results.
- A review no longer flags an issue that a guard or framework default outside the change already fully handles before the touched code runs.
- Debugging now traces the full chain from cause to symptom and treats an unexplained jump as the next thing to investigate rather than a conclusion.
- When candidate causes keep getting ruled out, the investigator steps back to ask why it is stuck instead of spawning more variations of a dead theory.

## 1.2.2 - 2026-06-04

- Fact-gathering and review steps now lead with the essentials and call out what they couldn't determine instead of guessing to fill a gap.
- The assistant lists the unknowns it hit and says plainly when it doesn't know, rather than answering with silent confidence.
- The reflect command drops its report template: it lists the big issues as plain bullets, or says nothing clears the bar in one line.

## 1.2.1 - 2026-06-04

- A build or type-check now runs when Claude finishes a task, blocking a broken build that the tests didn't catch.
- The after-edit formatter now reports lint problems rather than silently rewriting code to fix them.
- The finish-line test check now catches failures it had been silently letting through.
- A missing or timed-out test runner is no longer misread as a failing test.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-06-04

A big change is now built and reviewed in verified increments instead of in a single pass at the end, so problems surface early while each piece is small.

- A large change is broken into checkpoints, with each one built, reviewed, and confirmed before the next begins.
- A step that drifts from the agreed plan pauses for a fresh look instead of carrying the drift forward.
- Small changes proceed exactly as before, with no extra ceremony.

## 1.1.11 - 2026-06-03

- Plan approval now shows a short plain-language summary, a concrete example, and a small visual before you confirm.
- The smallest auto-approved changes stay silent as before.

## 1.1.10 - 2026-06-03

- Correctness review now runs on a stronger model for sharper findings on every change.
- Performance review catches more real slowdowns - loops that scale badly with data size and waits that should run in parallel.

## 1.1.9 - 2026-06-03

- A change that writes to a database, file, network, or payment system is now reviewed for whether running it twice is safe, flagging any step that would double-apply or corrupt on a re-run.

## 1.1.8 - 2026-06-03

- Each step now runs at a thinking depth matched to its job instead of all inheriting the deepest setting, so the hardest planning and reviews go deep while routine checks stay lean.
- The security review and the external-research step each moved to a stronger model for more reliable findings.

## 1.1.7 - 2026-06-02

- Planning and troubleshooting steps now look up a library, package, or version against current sources whenever the work commits to one, instead of only when something feels uncertain.
- Each looked-up fact is recorded with its source and a confidence tag, so an assumption that could not be confirmed is visible rather than silently trusted.

## 1.1.6 - 2026-06-02

- Risky parts of a task are now de-risked by a prototype matched to what is actually uncertain - an integration, a data shape, or whether something is fast enough.
- When the look of a UI is unsettled you get a visual picker; when the steps a user moves through are unsettled you get a separate clickable walk-through, each handed straight to the plan.

## 1.1.5 - 2026-06-02

- A step whose result is lost to an internal error now recovers on its own from the work already on disk, instead of stalling the run.
- A step that hangs is now noticed and unstuck automatically, so a single stuck step no longer freezes everything behind it.
- You are pulled in only when the recovered work genuinely does not add up, not on every hiccup.

## 1.1.4 - 2026-06-01

- Every code or system change now waits for plan approval before any edit is made, so nothing runs on a plan you have not okayed.
- A small system or trivial change clears that approval with a single tap, and a one-file change clears it automatically.
- How deeply a change is reviewed no longer rides on whether it needs tests, so a large change gets a full review even when there is nothing new to test.

## 1.1.3 - 2026-06-01

- The worked examples in the workflow guide now match what a run actually does.
- A run shows a compact status card instead of narrating each step as it happens.
- Runs are quieter and cost less context per task.

## 1.1.2 - 2026-06-01

- An unclear system or OS request now asks a clarifying question instead of stalling.
- Cancelling a destructive system step now ends the run cleanly, with nothing applied.

## 1.1.1 - 2026-05-31

- A research or review step that gets stuck on a slow or unreachable source no longer hangs the workflow - it gives up on that step and either moves on or tells you.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-05-31

The pipeline now recognizes four kinds of work instead of three, each routed to the steps it actually needs.

- Loose discussion stays fast and inline; a web search or a quick visual is offered before it runs, never forced.
- Throwaway exploration now spans code, diagrams, and mockups in one sandbox, not just code.
- System and OS-level work - configs, troubleshooting, command-line tooling - is its own track, with a safety check before anything destructive or irreversible runs.
- Independent checks now run in parallel instead of one after another, so results come back sooner.

## 1.0.8 - 2026-05-31

- When the workflow reworks an earlier plan after a correction, it now amends that exact plan instead of redrafting it from scratch, so your prior decisions survive.
- When tests need a fix or fill, the existing tests are amended in place rather than rewritten, keeping the cases you already had.

## 1.0.7 - 2026-05-31

- A malformed router call - a mistyped request key, or a request that isn't a JSON object at all - now fails loudly (names the problem, exits nonzero) instead of silently dropping it and looking like a finished task.
- UI-only reviews (accessibility, design consistency, UX) now fire only when a change actually touches UI files, instead of on every logic change.
- The screenshot-based visual check is now strictly opt-in - it runs only when you ask for it.
- The planner now receives the investigator's diagnosis on a bug fix, so it designs against the identified root cause.

## 1.0.6 - 2026-05-31

- Documentation, config, and version-only changes now go straight to implementation, with no test-writing step when there is nothing to test.
- Logic changes still hold the build until failing tests are written and validated first.

## 1.0.5 - 2026-05-31

- Documentation, version, and configuration changes now finish in a few quick steps instead of the full process.
- Changes that add real logic still require failing tests to be written and checked before any code is touched.
- Trivial changes now get a focused correctness check rather than the full review pass.

## 1.0.4 - 2026-05-31

- Multi-step tasks now run their steps in dependency order and reuse each step's real output instead of guessing ahead and redoing work.
- You now see which steps are planned, running, and done at every turn, instead of the work happening silently.
- The workflow recomputes the plan once per step instead of twice, cutting wasted work on every task.
- Background steps now hand back just their conclusion instead of a full transcript, leaving far more room before a long task fills up.

## 1.0.3 - 2026-05-31

- Every code review now also flags unclear names - vague, misleading, or wrongly scoped - judged on their own terms.
- Code reviews now call out unstated assumptions: the inputs, ordering, and environment premises code relies on but never guards.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-05-31

- Reporting a bug now drops you straight into a fix instead of a separate diagnosis track.
- Discussion mode lays out options with worked examples and asks the single question that matters, without touching your code.
- Throwaway prototypes skip the full review pass, running only the checks that matter for sandbox code.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-05-30

- Documentation and the glossary now match the composed-route model end to end - the old step-and-tier diagrams, the retired complexity classifier, and stale "backward-edge budget" references are gone.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-05-30

This is a ground-up rewrite of how alp-river works. Every prior version sorted your task into one of five size tiers and ran a fixed list of steps for that tier - the size decided the work. That model is gone. A deterministic router now reads your request and composes a route from a catalog of independent stages, assembling only what the task needs and reshaping it mid-flight as each stage discovers more. Size is no longer a dial you're sorted into; it's a readout of whatever route the work earned. The fixed pipeline, the tier gates, the backward-edge budget - all of it collapsed into a single rule: keep composing until the route converges.

- Routine changes move faster and interrupt you less; big or risky ones still earn clarification, planning, adversarial challenge, and review - because the work called for it, not because a tier label said so.
- New lightweight modes: drop into discussion or throwaway prototyping without spinning up the whole build pipeline, and slide back into building when you're ready.
- Tests come first - the workflow can't write implementation code until failing tests exist and have been checked against what you actually asked for.
- You can see what is about to run and why, and you are interrupted only when your answer would change the outcome.

## 0.3.6 - 2026-05-30

- When the pipeline asks you to decide something, each option now shows a concrete example of what it produces - so you can answer without first asking for one.
- Those prompts now lead with the decision and cut the filler, making the choice easier to grab at a glance.

## 0.3.5 - 2026-05-29

- The workflow now loads reliably at the start of every session instead of arriving cut off.
- After compacting a long conversation, your task's intent, plan, and decisions come back intact.
- Automated reviews and planning now consistently apply the shared review and code-quality rules they previously only pointed at.

## 0.3.4 - 2026-05-20

- Planning, implementation, and review now lean toward simpler local code with explicit dependencies and strong types.
- Reviews call out the AI-style code that creeps in - defensive branches no one needs, layers without a second use, hidden state.

## 0.3.3 - 2026-05-20

- Eight pipeline agents now have an optional persona voice - prototyper as an optimist, plan-challenger as a skeptic, fixer as a cynic, security-reviewer as a defender, and others.
- Override or swap any agent's persona under `alpRiver.psychologyOverrides` in `.claude/settings.local.json`.

## 0.3.2 - 2026-05-19

- `/alp-river:reflect` looks back at the current session and surfaces friction worth tuning in the workflow.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-05-19

- New chats in a project with no setup get a one-line nudge before you start typing.
- The same nudge now shows up on medium tasks too, not just big ones.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-05-18

Simplification: the four entry commands fold into one, and the assistant figures out what kind of work you mean from how you describe it.

- One command - `/alp-river:go` replaces the old `/feature`, `/plan`, `/investigate`, and `/fix`.
- The assistant figures out from your text whether it's a bug or a feature.
- On bigger tasks you get a Continue/Stop choice after the plan - design-only is one keystroke.
- Plain chat works without the command. Same pipeline either way.

## 0.2.6 - 2026-05-17

- Every follow-up confirms intent first - even one-liners.
- UI design choices get a picker page you flip through, not a text debate.

## 0.2.5 - 2026-05-16

- Acceptance criteria declare how they get verified - and the reviewer enforces it.
- Visual review is opt-in - one keystroke when you want it, silent when you don't.
- High-novelty work gets two prototypes side-by-side, not one.

## 0.2.4 - 2026-05-15

- Work that's too big gets flagged before it starts - split it, force it through, or drop it.

## 0.2.3 - 2026-05-13

- Intent, clarify, and plan-critique rounds ask via a picker, not prose.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-05-11

- Big jobs pause to ask if they're worth doing - keep going, narrow, or drop.
- The plan critic flags when a plan reaches farther than the goal needs.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-05-10

- New architecture review catches shallow wrappers and leaky interfaces.
- Quality and structure reviews now own clearly separate concerns.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-05-08

Project context becomes a first-class input. Subagents read your project's intent, stack, glossary, and prior decisions automatically instead of guessing.

- Subagents auto-read project context from `docs/` - intent, stack, glossary, ADRs.
- `/alp-river:setup` bootstraps those docs interview-style.
- Reviewers record novel terms and drift during a run; you pick what to keep.
- `/alp-river:adr` drafts a single architectural decision record from title + summary.

## 0.1.5 - 2026-05-02

- `/compact` no longer resets in-progress work.
- Pipeline steps read sequentially - the old conditional step is folded in.

## 0.1.4 - 2026-05-02

- Intent and clarification loop until nothing new comes up (cap 5 rounds).
- Agents check the codebase and the web before asking you.
- The main agent doesn't read your code during intent confirmation - a subagent does.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-05-02

- Code review splits into two passes - correctness and quality - so one no longer softens the other.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-05-02

- The intent restatement says what should be true when done, not how it gets done.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-05-01

- Reviewers read changed files directly - no more pre-built diff.
- Adjacent cleanup is its own thing now, not mixed into reviewer findings.
- Health-checker and fixer cleaned up.
- Workspace config added for local dev.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-04-26

Initial release. A multi-step pipeline that scales by task size - small tasks skip the heavy gates, big ones get full review and self-heal.

Most code assistants either rush past intent and get the wrong thing, or pile every reviewer onto every task and add friction where none is needed. alp-river splits the difference. A classifier reads each task, picks the right depth, and runs the matching set of specialist agents underneath.

- Tasks get classified S, M, L, or XL - small ones skip review, big ones get the full pipeline.
- Plan, build, review, and self-heal are separate steps so they don't soften each other.
- After-compaction state recovery so long sessions don't lose your intent or plan.
- Five slash commands cover feature work, fixes, plans, investigations, and reviews.
